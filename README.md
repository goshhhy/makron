Hi! This is my window manager. It's not really ready for use. I started it a few years back when I was much worse at coding, and I'm surprised I got as far as I did.

I began writing it because I couldn't find any other window managers for X that worked how I wanted - in particular, I would really like an identical implementation of the Stack & Tile window management system from Haiku.

This project hasn't quite gotten to that point. At the moment, functionality is very basic. It can just barely manage windows. Stack and tile functionality and general desktop usability is a ways away. It'll require some serious work in order to become as usable as I'd like.

Check back later! Maybe I'll have it more done.
